# Source directory to output destination mappings
# Each entry specifies how to process files from a source directory

    transform_links: true      # Convert [[wikilinks]] to markdown links

# Image handling
images:
  source_dir: "assets/images"     # Obsidian image directory
  destination_dir: "assets/img"   # Output image directory

# Link transformation settings
links:
  # URL format for generated links
  # Available variables: {collection}, {slug}
  url_format: "/{collection}/{slug}.html"

  # If a link target is not found in the mapping:
  # - "text": Extract display text only (backward compatible)
  # - "keep": Keep original [[link]] format
  # - "warn": Extract text but log warning
  fallback_mode: "text"

# Front matter settings
front_matter:
  # Enable front matter processing
  # If false, skips all front matter processing
  enabled: true

  # Front matter type: "base" (generic) or "jekyll"
  type: "jekyll"

  # Preserve original filename as title in front matter (e.g. "ABA problém" instead of "aba-problem")
  # Useful because filenames get slugified during conversion
  preserve_original_title: true

  # Jekyll-specific settings (only used when type is "jekyll")
  jekyll:
    # Automatically create front matter for files that don't have any
    auto_add: true
    # Default layout value when creating new front matter
